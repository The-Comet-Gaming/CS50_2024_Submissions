# Credit
## Problem to Solve
In a filed called `credit.py` in a folder called `sentimental-credit`, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via `print`) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Your program this time should be written in Python!

## Specification
- So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be `AMEX\n` or `MASTERCARD\n` or `VISA\n` or `INVALID\n`, nothing more, nothing less.
- For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card).
- Best to use `get_int` or `get_string` from CS50’s library to get users’ input, depending on how you to decide to implement this one.
