# Mario
## Problem to Solve
In a file called `mario.py` in a folder called `sentimental-mario-less`, write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Your program this time should be written in Python!

## Specification
- To make things more interesting, first prompt the user with `get_int` for the half-pyramid’s height, a positive integer between `1` and `8`, inclusive.
- If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than `8`, you should re-prompt for the same again.
- Then, generate (with the help of `print` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
- Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
