## If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I started by quering the database for the relevant sets of values refered too in the problem set 7 songs description, that being "energy, valence, and danceability" with
the goal to retrieve the lowest, highest, and average values of each set of data. I found that the average values for energy, valnce and danceability where:
0.65906, 0.484443 and 0.71646 respectively. From there I was able to infer a characterisation of the user's music aura using the lowest and highest values to compare the
averages to the relative values as follows:
Yellow and Purple


## Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The reason the calculated aura may not be very representative of the listener is because music as a medium is inherently subjective and personal. A company / industry can
use a set of generally agreed upon ideas and opinions of what music sounds happy, sad, etc and conveys what emotion and feeling. But ultimately any given piece of music is
still open to being intrepreted differently by each each person that hears it and how they feel when listening to it.
Also the data sets used for determining an audio aura do not include lyrics. Which also determine what message a song is converying, a pretty up-beat and positive sounding
backing track might have lyrics talking about the existential dread of the inevitiable heat death of the universe or something or other.
The inclusion of the lyrics and the "message" being conveyed by the song into the equation determining a user's music aura can possibly make it more "authentic".
